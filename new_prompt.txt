taking a look at the other files for inspiration, write the overlay printing file to do the following: calibrate the camera on all png images in log_reconstruction/laser_plane_calibration/, find the chessboard position in all images, find the laser plane (the laser blade is blue) by using linear algebra on the chessboard positions, then give me a 3d plot of all the chessboards (allowing me to select which one) along with the transparent laser plane, now that you know the laser plane position. obviously the laser blade has speckle, take that into account. after detecting the chessboards positions, you need to detect the blue laser blade hitting each chessboard along a different line, and presume that line is part of a plane because the laser is fixed relative to the camera. it's only the chessboard that is moving.
