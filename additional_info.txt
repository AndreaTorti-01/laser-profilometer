*CALIB_CB_ADAPTIVE_THRESH Use adaptive thresholding to convert the image to black and white, rather than a fixed threshold level (computed from the average image brightness).

*CALIB_CB_NORMALIZE_IMAGE Normalize the image gamma with equalizeHist before applying fixed or adaptive thresholding.

CALIB_CB_FILTER_QUADS Use additional criteria (like contour area, perimeter, square-like shape) to filter out false quads extracted at the contour retrieval stage.

CALIB_CB_FAST_CHECK Run a fast check on the image that looks for chessboard corners, and shortcut the call if none is found. This can drastically speed up the call in the degenerate condition when no chessboard is observed.

CALIB_CB_PLAIN All other flags are ignored. The input image is taken as is. No image processing is done to improve to find the checkerboard. This has the effect of speeding up the execution of the function but could lead to not recognizing the checkerboard if the image is not previously binarized in the appropriate manner.
